# planet-generator
A recreation of an old Python project in C#. Generates planet objects and gives them various random attributes.
Further modified for a submitted project.

The three requirements for the project met are:
1) A 'master loop' that allows the program to be re-run any number of times, and also allows for the option to quit out.
2) Lists that become populated and draw objects or other items from the list to output data.
3) A conversion tool that allows for conversion to and from various astronomical distances.
