# planet-generator
A recreation of an old Python project in C#. Generates planet objects and gives them various random attributes. Further modified for a submitted project. This was something I was doing for fun around January and have slowly built it up since then. I'm going to continue to work on it for the forseeable furture as well. One feature I'd still really like to get working is the Terrain Generator using a noise function and bitmaps.

The three requirements for the project met are:
1) A 'master loop' that allows the program to be re-run any number of times, and also allows for the option to quit out.
2) Lists that become populated and draw objects or other items from the list to output data.
3) A conversion tool that allows for conversion to and from various astronomical distances.
